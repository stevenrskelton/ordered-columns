	<h1>Content Generated by Templates</h1>

	Column content can come from any template, DOM, or component; so it's easy to generate <code>article</code>s from JSON:

<prism-js language="markup">&lt;ordered-columns&gt;
	&lt;template repeat="{{article in articles}}"&gt;
		&lt;article&gt;
			&lt;!--regular DOM --&gt;
		&lt;/article&gt;
	&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/ordered-columns&gt;</prism-js>

	<polymer-element name="eff-articles">
		<template>
			<h2>JSON</h2>

			Input from JSON can come from anywhere: generated, web service, or inlined.

			<json-stringify data="{{articles}}" json="{{json}}" style="display:none"></json-stringify>
			<prism-js language="javascript" inputValue="{{json}}"></prism-js>

			<br>

You expect to be able to open it up, mess with it, and improve it. At the very least, you expect it to continue to work for its intended purpose.\n\nWhat you don\'t expect is that the manufacturer will remotely cause the device to stop functioning unless you agree to be bound by new legal terms governing your relationship with them.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/nintendo-updates-take-wii-u-hostage-until-you-agree-new-legal-terms' },

And this criticism might involve someone commenting on the organization’s trademarked name or logo. For example, opponents of the NRA have suggested that “NRA Stands for Next Rifle Assault.” Critics of the ACLU have mocked it as the “Anti-Christian Lawyers Union.” The former CEO of the RIAA was fond of deriding EFF as the “Everything for Free Foundation.” Whether you think these parodies are brilliant or lame, there should be no question that they are fully protected by the First Amendment.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/eff-court-trademark-not-censorship-tool' },

Whether you\'re reading about the latest security breaches across the Net, or the jaw-dropping details of the latest NSA leak, or you\'re explaining the importance of crypto to your blank-faced family, or struggling to stop your own government\'s plans on burning your right to privacy, it\'s sometimes easy to just throw up your hands in despair and give it all up.\n\nWhat can anyone realistically do when online eavesdropping is increasingly pervasive, and governments and companies seem determined to keep it that way? What can anyone do, alone, to change the downward spiral of security and privacy online? It doesn\'t help when so many people seem to shrug at the risks and consequences of an omniscient state or cartel, no matter how many times you have explained your fears.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/they-fight-surveillance-and-you-can-too' },

In other words, Adobe is not only tracking your reading habits, it’s making it really, really easy for others to do so as well.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/adobe-spyware-reveals-again-price-drm-your-privacy-and-security' },

We\'ve read about it in George Orwell\'s 1984, we\'ve heard about it being practised by oppressive regimes such as North Korea, and now we\'re witnessing it first-hand, in our own supposed liberal democracies including the United States, the United Kingdom and now Australia.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/stop-spies-australians-rise-against-mandatory-data-retention' },

This is the seventh round of secretive meetings, and not much is known about the exact issues that are on the negotiating table. However a press release issued today confirms that “intellectual property” (IP) rights were one of four areas given focus in this round of negotiations. Given how notoriously captured by corporate interests IP discussions in trade negotiations are, this has us very worried.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/eu-us-trade-negotiations-continue-shutting-out-public-when-will-they-learn' },

Now in its eighth year, Open Access Week is an international event that celebrates the wide-ranging benefits of enabling open access to information and research–as well as the dangerous costs of keeping knowledge locked behind publisher paywalls.\n\nFrom October 20 to 26, academics, researchers, and curious minds everywhere will be encouraged to learn about the various hurdles to open knowledge and share stories of positive advancements in the effort to make open access the norm in scholarship and research.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/knowledge-should-not-be-trapped-behind-paywall-get-ready-open-access-week' },

One of the main components of the software is KeyAlert, a keystroke-capturing function that records everything a user types.\n\nKeyAlert has two major functions. First, it logs keystrokes on the user\'s hard drive. Second, it allows the person installing the software to set certain keywords. Whenever those keywords are typed, the computer sends an email with those keystrokes to the person who installed the software.', link: 'https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/computercop-howto:' }
